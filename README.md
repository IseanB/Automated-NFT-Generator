# Automated-NFT-Generator
This project used Blender 2.92.0, Python, and a privately curated set of 3D models, to produce both a high and low quality image file of uniquely generated images called "Cosmic Bears". These images were then posted to opeansea.io, an NFT marketplace, to become NFTs that can be bought and sold.

# Additional Information

- 36 Visual Characteristics can be customized.
- Designed, Coded, Tested, and In-Use from June 2021 to December 2021.
