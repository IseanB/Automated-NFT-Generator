# Automated-NFT-Generator
This single file interacted with Blender 2.92.0, and a privately curated set of 3D models, to produce both a high and low quality image file of uniquely generated "Cosmic Bears". These images were then posted to opeansea.io, an NFT marketplace, to become NFTs that can be bought and sold.
