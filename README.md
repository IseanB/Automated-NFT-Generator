# Automated-NFT-Generator
This project used Blender 2.92.0, Python, and a privately curated set of 3D models, to produce both a high and low quality image file of uniquely generated images called "Cosmic Bears". These images were then posted to opeansea.io, an NFT marketplace, to become NFTs that can be bought and sold.

# Tools Used
 Blender, Python, Opensea.io, IPFS(for image storage)

# Additional Information
- 112 3D-Objects either independently designed or imported and modified, includes light fixtures and orienting curves for certain models.
- 36 Visual Characteristics can be customized.
- Designed, Coded, Tested, and In-Use from May 2021 to October 2021.
- Collection can be found [here](https://opensea.io/collection/cosmic-bears-1).
